## Setup Your Free API Key

> To fetch the news data from the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) backend server, we'll need to generate a new Api Key. To do so, head over to the News API official site and click on the “Get API key” button to register for a new account. 

> Once the registration process is done, you’ll be redirect to dashboard where the API key is already generated for you. 

> Now, to implement your key, open the `/src/App.vue` file. Then, inside the `<script>` tag put you key to where it said: 'Put_Your_API_Key_Here' as shown below:

```
<script>
...
data() {
    return {
      drawer: true, // true to show/hide the side navigation drawer 
      api_key: 'Put_Your_API_Key_Here',
      articles: [],
      errors: [] 
    }
  },
...
</script>
```
